            In a collaborative effort with two other students, we created a counterfeit
bakery website that specializes in the selling of cookies. For the project, we
researched the area to identify the most popular business type. After reaching the
conclusion to create a bakery website, I was chosen to become the group leader.
Throughout the project, I designed the interface, came up with the design aesthetic,
tracked important dates, assigned task to my group members, and presented our
finished project to the class. The website had an order page, menu, a login page,
shopping cart, about, and a nutrition table for allergies. This website was
developed in the PHP Storm web development program. This coding platform is
known to be most common in professional websites around the globe. The results of
our website were highly effective and successful. Regarding my experience, this
project shows how well I can lead a team and still create a masterfully crafted
website through group effort.
