            I worked with the creators of Sweet.io to create a website that was
            easy for their customers to navigate and understand. This website is
            a one paged website, however there are links at the top of the page
            to take customers to the separate sections of the website. The home
            page lists all of the pages in one area. The about page contains two
            pictures of the creators, and describes the company as a whole. The
            contact page makes it easy for customers to contact the company
            about any questions or placing an order for catering. The products
            page consisted of pictures of the desserts, as well as prices and
            client testimonials about the products. There is a white space
            between each page as well.

            “Andrea has made our website appear elegant yet flavorful, just like
            our desserts. We have received more orders due to her new beautiful
            layout for our website. She is perfect to hire when you need a
            website with just a taste of elegance!”
