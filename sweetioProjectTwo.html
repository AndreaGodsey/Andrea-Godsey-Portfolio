            This web application is inspired by many popular bakery websites, yet also
contains a clever minimalistic approach regarding its design. The colors of this
platform reflect a more elegant design, displaying to the user how delicious their
products are. The website is simple to navigate, with each webpage being linked
within the navigation bar. The products offered at this bakery are displayed in a
gallery format in the products page, providing the user more information about the
products listed. This platform was created on the coding program known as Visual
Studio Code, which is known for being one of the most useful coding programs out
there currently. I created this website alone and was able to still display all
information in a refined manner with a minimalistic aesthetic. This inspired platform shows that I am
capable of even making a simplistic website idea become a reality just by my
design choices alone. The website is one of the best examples of
my creativity in the graphic design and interface fields.
