            This platform was developed after careful research over the functionality and appearance of travel websites. This website specifically offers tickets to places all over the world. Within the website, there is information that is displayed about each place that is offered to explore by the travel agency. In this platform, there is a home page, a gallery of places to travel, an about, special offers, blogs, and contact information. This website can function through only the home page, with links in the navigation bar being able to take the user to numerous different pages on the site. This way, the platform is more organized and easier to follow, even if the user gets lost in the platform. What I have gained from this experience is that this website displays how well I can organize a website in the most sophisticated yet simple way. I can create an organized code for developers to be able to update consistently.
