            I worked with the creators of the Soap Factory to create a useable
            website for customers to order their products easily. There are four
            pages to this website, listed as Home, About, Products, and Contact
            information. The home page consists of a small summary about what
            the company has to offer. The about page consists of information
            about the creators of the company, and its creation. The contacts
            page makes it easy for customers to ask questions or to make
            requests to the company. Finally, there is their products page,
            consisting of pictures and descriptions of their soap. There is an
            image at the top of the page that is consistent throughout the
            website, as well as sideways text to tell about what page the viewer
            is on.

            website for the company! Our website was needing an update, and
            Andrea provided with a creative layout that has our customers
            ordering our products more often! We have benefited immensley from
            Andrea’s new website! Would recommend her to anyone!”
