            For this project, I had developed a website that was centered around the
creating and selling of homemade soap products. The website is uniquely designed
with a sophisticated aesthetic. The platform was created in Visual Studio Code.
This coding program is known for being a useful tool regarding the development of
sophisticated websites. This website has a home, products, about, and contact
page. On the left-hand side of each page is their respective titles, formatted into a
sophisticated font and color. The interface appears minimalistic, yet the colors
make the assets of the platform appear more pleasing to the viewer. The website is
organized and easy to navigate for users that want to learn more about the
homemade soaps offered by the inspired company. In the end, the website was
successful at impressing users who tested its functionality. Regarding my
experience, the website’s unique designs and format displays my skill in creating a
website that is not only functional but visually appealing. The positive results and
feedback of this inspired platform’s creation displays my ability to work in
collaborative or independent projects.
