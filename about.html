          "I am a dedicated and detail-oriented web design student pursuing a
          Bachelor of Science in Media Arts and Science at IU Indianapolis. My
          passion for web development started in high school during a graphic
          design course, where I realized my love for translating visual designs
          into functional, engaging interfaces. A visit from an IUI recruiter
          during that class solidified my decision to pursue web development,
          and since then, Iâ€™ve focused on honing my skills and expanding my
          creative and technical expertise.

          <!--Middle Paragraph-->
          Throughout my college journey, I have developed proficiency in Graphic
          Design, JavaScript, CSS, React.js, Visual Studio Code, and PHP Storm.
          I am committed to using these tools to create visually appealing and
          user-friendly websites that meet both client needs and aesthetic
          goals. My ambition is to become a web developer known for crafting
          innovative, accessible, and interactive platforms that captivate
          users.

          <!--Paragraph on the bottom-->
          Outside of my studies, I enjoy drawing, creating short animations, and
          staying current with the latest trends in web design. My creative
          pursuits fuel my passion for design, and I aim to continuously learn
          and evolve within the fast-paced world of web development. I am
          excited about the future and am committed to lifelong learning as I
          work toward making a lasting impact through my designs."
