        <!--Very Top Paragraph-->
        My name is Andrea Godsey, and I am twenty years old. I currently live in
        Springville, Indiana, with my family and two dogs. I enjoy reading
        mystery novels, such as Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot in my spare
        time. I also enjoy creating drawings, and am currently working on a
        graphic novel series. I play video games as well, and have enjoyed
        watching cartoons and movies ever since I was a kid.

        <!--Middle Paragraph-->
        When I was around ten years old, I had been inspired by many of my
        cartoons I watched to become an animator. I loved the bright colors of
        all the characters, and enjoyed watching the story progress in each
        episode. I collect art books of famous movies and video games for this
        reason: to continue to find work that motivates me to continue towards
        my dream. Of course, I also wanted to have many talents in the
        technological field, such as web development. I wanted to have more than
        one talent, so I would be able to excel in my dream career. After all,
        there is no such thing as having too many talents.

        <!--Paragraph on the bottom-->
        I have created websites for about a year now, and am able to express my
        creativity in each page. I like having bright colors be the theme of my
        many websites. The theme, to me, has always been the most important
        aspect of a website. I excel in this area in particular, since I have
        always been able to come up with more ideas in a short period of time.
        This theme that appears in each of my websites, is what makes me stand
        out as a web developer.
